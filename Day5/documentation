 Random Forest for SMS Spam Detection
Using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from UCI, you’ll build a model to classify incoming text messages as spam or ham (not spam).
This project introduces natural language preprocessing, converting text to numerical form using TF-IDF, and building a Random Forest classifier, an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better performance and robustness.

You’ll evaluate the model using precision and recall, which are essential for imbalanced classification tasks like spam detection.
  Project Guide: Build It Yourself
1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Download the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset is usually in a .tsv format with two columns:

label → "ham" or "spam"

message → the actual SMS text

Check class balance to understand how many spam vs ham messages are present.

2. Text Preprocessing
Clean the text messages:

Lowercase everything

Remove punctuation, special characters

Remove stopwords (like “and”, “is”, etc.)

Optionally: apply stemming or lemmatization

This reduces noise and improves model performance.

3. Convert Text to TF-IDF Features
Use a TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) emphasizes important words and downplays common ones.

The output is a high-dimensional sparse matrix representing each message.

4. Train the Random Forest Classifier
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Use RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.

Fit the model on the training data.

Random Forests are robust and handle noisy features well, which is great for text.

5. Evaluate the Model
Make predictions on the test set.

Instead of just accuracy (which can be misleading with imbalanced classes), use:

Precision: How many predicted spams were actually spam?

Recall: How many actual spam messages did the model catch?

You can also compute the F1-score for balance between the two.

Bonus: use a confusion matrix to visually see TP, TN, FP, FN.
