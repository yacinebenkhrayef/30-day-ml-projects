 K-Nearest Neighbors for Digit Classification
In this project, you’ll use the Digits dataset from sklearn.datasets to build a model that classifies handwritten digits (0–9).
The algorithm of choice is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — a simple, yet powerful instance-based learning method that predicts a label based on the “closest” training examples in the feature space.

You’ll also tune the K value (number of neighbors) to optimize accuracy and get hands-on experience with distance metrics and model performance.

Project Guide: Build It Yourself
1. Load and Visualize the Dataset
Use load_digits() from sklearn.datasets.

Each sample is an 8x8 grayscale image of a digit.

Explore:

data → flattened pixel values (64 features per image)

images → original 8x8 matrices (for visualization)

target → actual digit labels (0–9)

Visualize a few digit images using matplotlib to understand what you’re working with.

2. Normalize the Features
KNN uses distance (like Euclidean), so feature scaling is essential.

Normalize pixel values to a common scale (e.g., 0–1 or standardize to mean=0, std=1).

This ensures all pixels contribute equally to distance calculations.

3. Train the KNN Classifier
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.

Train the model on the training set using a default K (like 3 or 5).

4. Tune the K Value
Try different values of K (number of neighbors).

Track accuracy on the validation or test set for each value.

Plot K vs Accuracy to find the best value (elbow point or highest accuracy).

Avoid very low or very high values of K:

Low K: more sensitive to noise

High K: more biased and smooth
