Day 1 Project – Linear Regression for California House Price Prediction
In this project, you’ll use the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets to build a Linear Regression model that predicts median house values in different districts of California based on features such as median income, average number of rooms, population, and more.
The goal is to understand the fundamentals of linear regression and learn how to evaluate a regression model using key performance metrics like MAE and RMSE.
Project Guide: Build It Yourself
1. Load the Dataset
•	Import the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets.
•	Extract features (X) and target (y) from the dataset.
•	Check what each feature represents (e.g., median income, house age, etc.).
2. Explore and Preprocess the Data
•	Convert the dataset into a DataFrame for easier analysis.
•	Explore basic statistics, data types, and check for missing values.
•	Optionally standardize or normalize the data (especially if you plan to try advanced models later).
3. Split the Dataset
•	Use train_test_split to divide the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
•	Make sure the split is random and reproducible (set a random_state).
4. Train a Linear Regression Model
•	Initialize the LinearRegression model from sklearn.linear_model.
•	Fit the model on the training set (X_train and y_train).
•	Review model coefficients to understand which features most affect the prediction.
5. Make Predictions & Evaluate the Model
•	Predict the target values using the test set.
•	Evaluate performance using:
o	MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – How far off your predictions are, on average.
o	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
•	Optionally calculate R² score to understand variance explained by the model.
What You’ll Learn
•	How to apply Linear Regression to real-world data
•	The importance of feature relationships in regression
•	How to evaluate a model using standard regression metrics
•	Practice with an actual dataset that’s more reflective of real housing markets
