 Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Prediction
In this project, you’ll use the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various medical features like mean radius, texture, symmetry, etc.
You’ll train a Logistic Regression model – perfect for binary classification – and evaluate its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix, which helps you see how well the model is distinguishing between the two classes.

  Project Guide: Build It Yourself
1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Use load_breast_cancer() from sklearn.datasets.

Understand the structure:

data: input features (X)

target: labels (y) → 0 = malignant, 1 = benign

feature_names: column names

Convert to a DataFrame for easier inspection.

2. Explore the Data
Use .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand feature distributions.

Check the balance of target classes (how many benign vs malignant samples).

Look for any missing values (though this dataset is usually clean).

3. Preprocess the Features
Standardize or normalize the feature values (important for logistic regression).

Why? Because logistic regression is sensitive to the scale of input data.

Optionally split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20).

4. Train a Logistic Regression Model
Initialize a logistic regression model using sklearn.linear_model.

Fit the model using the training data.

Once trained, use the model to predict on the test set.

5. Evaluate the Model
Accuracy Score: Check what % of predictions are correct.

Confusion Matrix: Gives insight into:

True positives (TP)

True negatives (TN)

False positives (FP)

False negatives (FN)

Optionally: calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for deeper insight.
